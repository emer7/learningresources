## What Is a Module?

You might often encounter the term such as _module, package, library, dependency, plugin,_ etc. when developing your own application in any programming languages, including JavaScript. We will not dive into the exact definition of each term because that is not the scope of this article, but we will define a module as a collection of code that share the common purpose or support a certain functionality that is placed in different file.

Let's say you have an application with functionalities A and B, where functionality A needs functionality B. Without modules, both of these functionalities are mixed together in the code base without a clear separation. With modules, we can separate those 2 functionalities into separate module each. When A need B, A will "include" B and A will be able to work as if A and B has never been separated. The exact usage of modules will be illustrated in the **How to Modularize JavaScript Code** section after the following section.

## Why Use Modules in JavaScript?

Following are reasons why use modules in JavaScript. The reasons below are not exclusive to JavaScript, but may also be general reasons for using modules in other languages.

**1. Better management of code base** <br>
Using modules will break the code base into smaller parts which if done well can help in managing a code base, especially a large one. To be able to modularize your code well, you can apply Software Engineering principles such as [SOLID](http://se-education.org/se-book/principles/solidPrinciples/index.html), etc.

**2. Namespacing** <br>
Because of how [JavaScript scoping](https://www.sitepoint.com/demystifying-javascript-variable-scope-hoisting/) works, avoiding global variable can be an issue. Modules allows JavaScript developer to avoid this problem by isolating the namespace to a specific module.

**3. Reusability** <br>
As per [Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle](http://se-education.org/se-book/principles/dryPrinciple/index.html), modules allows developers to reuse their code that is contained in a module. If for example we have an application that rely on a fuctionality such as string comparison function, we can separate that function into a module and let the application to use the function from that module instead of having to always repeating that function in all the places where it is needed.

## How to Modularize JavaScript Code?

There are 3 common ways to use modules in JavaScript: 1. using ES6 modules, 2. using CommonJS, 3. using the module pattern. While ES6 is the most recent and the official implementation, this article covers the other two as well because there is still a large number of existing projects that use them.

### ES6 modules

Introduced in 2015, ES6 modules is the official implementation of modules in JavaScript. It introduces 2 new syntax `import` and `export` to use modules in JavaScript.

In the example below, `index.js` needs the function `sumOfVariable` from `anExampleModule.js`. So, `anExampleModule.js` module will need to "export" the function using `export` syntax and `index.js` module will need to "import" that function using `import` syntax.

```js
// anExampleModule.js

var variableOne = 1;
var variableTwo = 2;

export sumOfVariable() {
    return variableOne + variableTwo;
}
```

```js
// index.js

import * as anExampleModule from './anExampleModule.js';

anExampleModule.sumOfVariable(); // 3
```

ES6 modules supports advanced features such as asynchronous loading, [tree shaking](https://medium.com/@netxm/what-is-tree-shaking-de7c6be5cadd), static code analysis, etc. These features will not be covered in this article.

Due to the very recent adoption of ES6 modules by browsers and there is still some browsers that do not support it, you might not be able to use ES6 modules right away in those unsupported browsers.

There are 2 workarounds for this issue. You can use [transpiler](https://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript-transpilers-what-they-are-why-we-need-them) such as [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [bundler](https://medium.com/@gimenete/how-javascript-bundlers-work-1fc0d0caf2da) such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to serve your application to those unsupported browsers or use one of the other two approaches mentioned below.

### CommonJS

It is common because it is used by NodeJS itself and hence a lot of NodeJS applications use it.

The example below will replicate the same example in previous chapter using CommonJS. `index.js` needs the function `sumOfVariable` from `anExampleModule.js`. So, `anExampleModule.js` module will need to "export" the function using `module.exports` syntax and `index.js` module will need to "import" that function using `require` syntax.

```js
// anExampleModule.js

var variableOne = 1;
var variableTwo = 2;

sumOfVariable = function() {
    return variableOne + variableTwo;
}

module.exports = {
  sumOfVariable: sumOfVariable,
};
```

```js
// index.js

var anExampleModule = require('./anExampleModule.js');

anExampleModule.sumOfVariable(); // 3
```

CommonJS is mainly used in NodeJS applications, but you can also use it outside of NodeJS by using [bundler](https://medium.com/@gimenete/how-javascript-bundlers-work-1fc0d0caf2da) such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). If your project requirement does not allow you to use bundler, the approach given in the next section does not need any external tool.

### Module Pattern

Using a technique in JavaScript called [IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE), JavaScript developers can create module by wrapping their code in an IIFE.

> An **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)** is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. <br>
> **Syntax:** `(function() { statements })();`

The example below will replicate the same example in previous chapters using module pattern. `index.js` needs the function `sumOfVariable` from `anExampleModule.js`. To achieve this, we use the `<script>` tag in HTML to "import" `anExampleModule.js` for `index.js` to use.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<script src="./anExampleModule.js" />
<script src="./index.js" />
```

```js
// anExampleModule.js

var anExampleModule = (function() {
    var variableOne = 1;
    var variableTwo = 2;

    var sumOfVariable = function() {
        return variableOne + variableTwo;
    }

    // We return an object with functions or variables
    // that we want to be exposed
    return {
        sumOfVariable: sumOfVariable
    }
})()
```

```js
// index.js

anExampleModule.sumOfVariable(); // 3
```

The result of importing the modules in the HTML will be as follow:
```js
// anExampleModule.js

var anExampleModule = (function() {
    var variableOne = 1;
    var variableTwo = 2;

    var sumOfVariable = function() {
        return variableOne + variableTwo;
    }

    // We return an object with functions or variables
    // that we want to be exposed
    return {
        sumOfVariable: sumOfVariable
    }
})()

// index.js

anExampleModule.sumOfVariable(); // 3
```

## Which to use?

With the launch of ES6 modules, one might think that why should we choose which one to use? Why not use ES6 modules right away?

If an application does not allow you to use transpiler and bundler perhaps because of the additional overhead or you just need to create a simple and lean application, you might want to consider implementing the module pattern.

If you will be developing a NodeJS application, you might want to use CommonJS because NodeJS does not natively support ES6 modules.

All in all, the best implementation depends on the nature of your project.

## How to start?

You can start with module pattern right away by refactoring segments of your code into different files and wrapping the code in IIFE.

If you are planning to use CommonJS or ES6 modules, you can start by refactoring segments of your code, but you will also need to be familiar with transpiler and bundler such as Babel and Webpack.
